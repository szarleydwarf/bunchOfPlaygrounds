 ## Running Unit Tests
 
 There are three ways to run unit tests;
 
 1. Product -> Test or Command-U. This usually runs all the test classes

 2. Click the arrow button in the test navigator
 3. Click the diamond button in the gutter

 You can also run an individual test method by clicking its diamond, either in the test navigator or in the gutter
 
 When a test succeeds, the diamond will turn green and show a check mark.

 When a test fails, the diamond will turn red and show a cross.
 Click the gray diamond at the end of `testPerformanceExample` to open the Performance Result

 As you are human & you make mistakes, you may need to debug you own unit tests.
 
 To help, Xcode allows you to add breakpoints when a test fails.
 
 In the breakpoint navigator, add a Test Failure Breakpoint, this will stop the test run when a test method posts a failure assertion
