 ## An Existing Project
 
 To add a unit-test target to an existing project:
 1. Open the test project you wish to add a test target to
 2. Navigate to the test navigator (Press Command + 6)
 3. Click the + button at the lower left corner
 4. Select `New Unit Test Target…` from the menu

 5. Accept the default product name for the test target
 6. By default the test target is the same as the project name but with the suffix **Tests**
 7. (Optional) Select the language you wish to use when testing. Yes you can have a project written in Objective-C and the tests written in Swift

 After adding the unit-test target the project navigator shows a new group—with the same name as the target—contains source files that implement a sample test case.
