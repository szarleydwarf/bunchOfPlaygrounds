Security is a key aspect of software development. Almost every mobile application deals with user information or communicates with a remote server. Even though security has improved dramatically over the past decades, it continues to be a hotly debated topic.
 
 Why does Apple take security so seriously? From the photos you take, to the number of steps that were achieved during the day, your iPhone stores a lot of personal data. Keeping this data safe is very important.
 
 Who are the attackers in the iOS ecosystem, and what do they want? An attacker might be a criminal, a business competitor, even a friend or relative. Not all attackers want the same thing. Some might want to cause damage or corrupt information, while others might want to see what presents they are getting for their birthdays.
 
 Itâ€™s your job to make sure that the data being held by your application is protected against potential threats. Fortunately, Apple has built many strong APIs that simplify this task.
